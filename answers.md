Work Complexity: The work complexity for the algorithm is O(n+m)O(n+m), where nn is the number of nodes and mm is the number of edges in the graph.

Reachability Complexity: The complexity of the reachable function is O(n)O(n). This occurs when each node in the graph is traversed to determine reachability.

Work Calculation: The calculated work complexity is O(n+M)O(n+M), indicating that the complexity is dependent on the number of nodes nn and edges MM.

Graph Representation Change: Switching to an adjacency matrix alters the work complexity of the reachable function to O(n2)O(n2) for the entire graph. This increase is due to the necessity of evaluating every possible connection between nodes, represented as entries in the matrix for each node.
